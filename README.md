# Would You Rather Project

To run this app you would need to go into the wyr-app directory and install node_modules locally by running yarn install or npm install.

Then start the project with yarn start or npm start

cd wyr-app
yarn install
yarn start

This is using the API starter code for the  project for Udacity's React & Redux course.
For styling I tried incorporating react bootstrap https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
